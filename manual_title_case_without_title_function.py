#Prog10. title() makes all first letter of each word in the string, capital letter. And all other letter in small case. Create a program that do the same functionality without using title() function.
#input text "I LOVE RADIOHEAD"
#like in program 1, use split to split the words and capitalize the first letter and lower the others
#print "I Love Radiohead"
